# Macroeconmic Performance and Growth Drivers in Top Asian Economies. 

1. Project Overview.
This project analyzes economic growth performance across the largest Asian economies using World Bank data. The dashboard explores relationships between GDP growth, investment, government spending, inflation, unemployment, and foreign direct investment (FDI).
The goal was to assess how macroeconomic factors and capital flows are associated with growth performance while distinguishing correlation from causation.

2. Business/Research Questions.
The dashboard was built to answer the following questions:
•	How has GDP growth evolved across top Asian economies over time?
•	What factors are associated with stronger growth performance?
•	How stable is growth when considering inflation and unemployment?
•	How do investment levels and trade openness relate to economic outcomes?

3. Tools and Skills used.
Tools and Technologies.
•	Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX measures, report design
•	World Bank Open Data
•	DAX (explicit measures, correlation calculation)
•	Data modeling (Fact table + country dimension)

4. Key Skills Demonstrated.
•	Time-series analysis
•	Scatter plot and quadrant analysis
•	Macroeconomic interpretation
•	Data storytelling and annotation
•	Responsible use of correlation vs causation

5. Methodology.
•	Created a unified fact table combining macroeconomic indicators.
•	Built explicit DAX measures for GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, investment, exports, and FDI.
•	Filtered analysis to top Asian economies by GDP (Current US$)
•	Used scatter plots to assess the relationship between growth and investment variables.
•	Applied reference lines and correlation measures to support exploratory analysis.
•	Avoid casual claims and focus on observed associations.

6. Key Findings.
Investment levels are generally associated with stronger GDP growth across major Asian economies. 
Higher growth periods often coincide with elevated inflation, reflecting macroeconomic trade-offs
Strong GDP growth does not always translate into immediate labor market improvements
Trade Openness and FDI inflows vary significantly across countries, contributing to differences in economic performance. 
 
7. What I learned.
The importance of distinguishing economic scale from growth rates. 
The need to frame insights carefully to avoid overstating causality.
How to balance statistical rigor with clear visual storytelling. 
The trade-offs involved in visual design (trend lines vs bubbles size)

8. Final Summary Line.
This project demonstrates my ability to combine economic reasoning, data modeling, and visualization design to communicate macroeconomic insights effectively.
